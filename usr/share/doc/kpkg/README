Kpkg is the Kwort Linux package manager. It allows the user to install, remove,
download and upgrade packages or the whole system.

FILES:

* kpkg: The kpkg itself, just execute it to install it.
* db.creater: This script is just for mirrors, it allow the administrator 
 to regenerate the packages database, so there is no need to edit the database 
 to add packages. To see how a mirror is setup see 
 ftp://200.3.124.37/pub/kwort/2.4/packages (Kwort main mirror). The mirror's 
 protocol can be any supported by wget.
* makepkg: This script allow the user to generate a Kwort package. The format
 of the package is: Name-Version-Arch-BuildAuthor. The author is not necessary.
 That will generate: Name-Version-Arch-BuildAuthor.tar.lzma
